24. WHAT IS A PARQUET FILE?
Parquet is a columnar format file supported by many other data processing systems. 
Spark SQL performs both read and write operations with Parquet file and consider it 
be one of the best big data analytics formats so far. 

Parquet is a columnar format, supported by many data processing systems. The advantages of having a columnar storage are as follows:

Columnar storage limits IO operations.
It can fetch specific columns that you need to access.
Columnar storage consumes less space.
It gives better-summarized data and follows type-specific encoding.

21. What is PageRank in GraphX?
PageRank measures the importance of each vertex in a graph, assuming an edge from u to v represents an endorsement of vâ€™s importance by u. 
For example, if a Twitter 

user is followed by many others, the user will be ranked highly.

GraphX comes with static and dynamic implementations of PageRank as methods on the PageRank Object. Static PageRank runs for a fixed number of iterations, while 

dynamic PageRank runs until the ranks converge (i.e., stop changing by more than a specified tolerance). GraphOps allows calling these algorithms directly as methods 

on Graph.


20. IS THERE AN API FOR IMPLEMENTING GRAPHS IN SPARK?
GraphX is the Spark API for graphs and graph-parallel computation. Thus, it extends the Spark RDD with a Resilient Distributed Property Graph.

The property graph is a directed multi-graph which can have multiple edges in parallel. Every edge and vertex have user defined properties associated with it. Here, 

the parallel edges allow multiple relationships between the same vertices. At a high-level, GraphX extends the Spark RDD abstraction by introducing the Resilient 

Distributed Property Graph: a directed multigraph with properties attached to each vertex and edge.

To support graph computation, GraphX exposes a set of fundamental operators (e.g., subgraph, joinVertices, and mapReduceTriplets) as well as an optimized variant of 

the Pregel API. In addition, GraphX includes a growing collection of graph algorithms and builders to simplify graph analytics tasks.
